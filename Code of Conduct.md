# Code of Conduct

As maintainers and contributors of **OffsetInspect**, we want this project to be a respectful, collaborative, and technically focused space.

By participating in this project (issues, pull requests, discussions, reviews, or any other interaction), you agree to the following principles:

---

## Our Standards

- Be respectful and professional in all interactions.
- Focus feedback on code, ideas, and behavior — never on the person.
- Assume good intent and ask clarifying questions instead of reacting with hostility.
- Welcome newcomers and help them understand the project where possible.
- Use clear, inclusive language and avoid insults, slurs, or personal attacks.
- Keep discussions relevant to OffsetInspect, security research, and the surrounding ecosystem.

Examples of behavior that is **not acceptable** include:

- Harassment, bullying, or personal insults.
- Discriminatory language or jokes targeting any group.
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission.
- Persistent disruptive behavior (spam, derailment, or bad-faith arguing).

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within:

- The OffsetInspect GitHub repository (issues, PRs, discussions, wiki, etc.).
- Any other project spaces (chat, calls, or other collaboration tools) that are used for project work.

---

## Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

1. Collect any relevant context (links, screenshots, etc.).
2. Contact the maintainer privately via GitHub (opening a minimal “Code of Conduct concern” issue if needed) or through any listed contact channel in the repository.

Reports will be reviewed in good faith. When appropriate, the maintainer may:

- Ask for more information.
- Give a private warning.
- Limit or block a user from interacting with the project.
- Take any other action reasonably needed to maintain a safe and productive environment.

---

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct. Decisions made in good faith to protect the project and its contributors are final.

Repeated or severe violations may result in temporary or permanent exclusion from project spaces.

Thank you for helping keep OffsetInspect a professional and constructive place to collaborate.
